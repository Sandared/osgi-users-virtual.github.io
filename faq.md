Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the Connection Between the OSGi Alliance and the Virtual OSGi Users' Forum?

The Virtual OSGi Users' Forum is an open, worldwide forum for users of OSGi technology. The OSGi Alliance has granted us permission to use the OSGi trademark in certain limited ways.

The OSGi Alliance does not fund the Users' Forum. Members of the Users' Forum are not automatically members of the OSGi Alliance or *vice versa* -- though there is some natural overlap.

### How can I Join the Virtual OSGi Users' Forum?

Membership is free, just sign up at our [registration page](/register.html).

### How can I Join the OSGi Alliance?

See the [OSGi Alliance membership page](https://www.osgi.org/join/).

### What does OSGi Stand For?

Just like Harry S. Truman's middle initial, OSGi does not actually stand for anything! The full name of the technology is simply OSGi.

The [OSGi Alliance](https://www.osgi.org) was formerly known as the "Open Services Gateway initiative", but that name is now obsolete.
